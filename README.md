# Brief Music Player
A Simple/Stupid Music Player written in LÃ–VE :musical_note: for no purpose other than to demonstrate what could be done with [Lovely-Imgui](https://github.com/YoungNeer/lovely-imgui)!

## Out of context stuff

I think it's my speciality to make apps just to demonstrate libraries - for eg [Arkanoid](https://github.com/YoungNeer/Arkanoid) was written only to demonstrate the "powers" of Anima, [Golf](https://github.com/ was also written to somewhat demonstrate auto-cursor. Both libraries never took off and turned out to be super-useless! I hope the same doesn't happen with LI :innocent:
